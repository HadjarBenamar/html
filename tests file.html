    <hr> test test 
    <pre style = "color : red" > i want to know what does this do now 
        as long                                          as i remember it is almost the same as the paragraph element but 
        it preserves the spaces and les sauts de ligne so 
        why not tryng 
        i also used the <b>style attribute</b> to turn the text <mark>red </mark>
