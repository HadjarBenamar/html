<body>
    <p>A banana is an elongated, edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by 
        several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.
         In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called
          "plantains", distinguishing them from dessert bananas</p>
